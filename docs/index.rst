Pythonflow: Dataflow programming for python.
============================================

Pythonflow is a simple implementation of `dataflow programming <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dataflow_programming>`_ for python. Users of `Tensorflow <https://www.tensorflow.org/>`_ will immediately be familiar with the syntax.

At Spotify, we use Pythonflow in data preprocessing pipelines for machine learning models because

* it automatically caches computationally expensive operations,
* any part of the computational graph can be easily evaluated for debugging purposes,
* it allows us to distribute data preprocessing across multiple machines.
